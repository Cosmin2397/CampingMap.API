## Project setup

- After cloning the repository run `cd client` and `npm install`
- In the client root create a `.env.local` file, copy and populate the environment variables from `.env.example`
- Run `npm run start` to open the project locally

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
